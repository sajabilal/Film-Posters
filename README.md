The app is in the main.py file .
To start the app execute the main.py file or run in pycharm.
For now i didnt made a requierments.txt form downloading packeges.
If you running on pycharm see that you got those packeges installed = flask , pymongo, requests and IMDbPY.
The app need to be conected to a pymongo database i managed to connect a pymongo server but we need to add insert and delete function.
